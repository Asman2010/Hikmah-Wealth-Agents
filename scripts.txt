Hello. To the person watching my demo video, thank you for your time and attention. My name is Asman, and I'd like to express my gratitude to NVIDIA and Langchain for hosting this incredible AI contest. It's been a fantastic experience participating and pushing the boundaries of what we can do with AI agents.

"I'll walk you through some small steps to easily run my project. First, open the root directory in your terminal. Then, install the required packages by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt` and pressing Enter. I recommend using a conda environment or another virtual environment for this."

"My code has two parts: the UI and the backend. For the UI, I'm using Streamlit. For the backend, I haven't directly used LangChain but rather CrewAI, which is built on top of LangChain. The reason I've used CrewAI is that it's much easier to integrate with LangChain's diverse tools."

"After installing the pip packages, navigate to the application directory by typing `cd src/app` and then run the application with `streamlit run app.py`."

"In this part of the code, I've implemented SearxNG for web browsing functionalities. SearxNG is an open-source metasearch engine that aggregates results from multiple search engines without tracking the user's activities, enhancing both the reliability and privacy of the data."

"However, I understand that setting up SearxNG in Docker might be a bit challenging. Even if you manage to set it up, running all the containers simultaneously can lead to errors. Therefore, I recommend only running the SearxNG container to avoid these issues."

However, I understand that setting up SearxNG in Docker might be challenging for some. In such cases, I recommend using the SERPER Dev tool. It's a practical alternative that integrates easily and can be a great backup if SearxNG setup isn't feasible."

"Thank you once again to NVIDIA and LangChain for this opportunity.
